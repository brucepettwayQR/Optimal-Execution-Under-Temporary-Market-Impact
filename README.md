# Optimal-Execution-Under-Temporary-Market-Impact
This repository contains the programs used to derive analytic solutions and Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approximations to the stochastic optimal control problems revolving temporary market impact.

This project studies optimal trade execution under temporary market impact within a stochastic optimal control framework, comparing deterministic and stochastic volatility formulations. In the deterministic setting, the associated Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation admits a closed form analytic solution for the optimal trading rate, revealing a monotonically increasing execution strategy and demonstrating that temporary market impact does not affect optimal costs or trading speed. For the stochastic volatility setting, the addition of stochastic volatility makes the problem high dimensional and non-seperable in state variables, motivating the use of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the value function and optimal control. The stochastic formulation reveals an inverse relationship between volatility and optimal trading speed, alongside a positive correlation between volatility and execution costs. Overall, the project highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of PINNs for solving stochastic control problems when analytical solutions are or are not available.
